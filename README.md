# redundant JSON parser for League of Legends champion and rune information.

these short python scripts read over JSON files from [Riot Assets](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol) to grab specific info. these short JSONs are used in another [OPGG](https://www.op.gg/champions/gragas/build) like project

'champParser' grabs ability and champion PNGs.
 'runeParser' does the same thing, but sorts them between keystone runes and sun-runes (perks)
